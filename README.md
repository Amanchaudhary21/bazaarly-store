# ShopNest

A practice online store made with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript (no frameworks).
Search, filters, cart, coupons, checkout, orders, a wish list, selling your own items
with a photo, and sign-in with email, phone number or Google.

> Demo only: no real payments, nothing is shipped, and accounts are saved only in your own browser.

## Live site

**https://amanchaudhary21.github.io/shopnest-store/**

Every push to the `main` branch publishes the `public/` folder again
(see `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`). It takes about a minute.

## Install it as an app

ShopNest is a Progressive Web App (PWA): `public/manifest.webmanifest` gives it a name and icons,
and `public/sw.js` saves its files so it also opens with no internet.

- **Windows (Edge or Chrome):** open the live site, then click the install icon in the address bar
  (or menu **Apps > Install ShopNest**). It gets its own window, Start menu entry and taskbar icon.
- **Android:** Chrome menu **Add to Home screen / Install app**.
- **iPhone:** Safari **Share > Add to Home Screen**.

## Publish it in the Microsoft Store

The Store version is made from the live site with Microsoft's free tool **PWABuilder**,
so every push to `main` also updates the Store app (no new upload needed for normal changes).

1. **Partner Center account:** sign up at <https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/registration>
   (individual developer account).
2. **Reserve the name:** Partner Center > Apps and games > **New product > MSIX or PWA app** >
   reserve a name, e.g. *ShopNest Demo Store*.
3. Open the new app > **Product management > Product identity**. Copy **Package/Identity/Name**,
   **Package/Identity/Publisher** and **Package/Properties/PublisherDisplayName**.
4. Go to <https://www.pwabuilder.com>, enter `https://amanchaudhary21.github.io/shopnest-store/`,
   click **Package For Stores > Windows > Generate Package**, and paste the three values from step 3.
5. Unzip the download. Back in Partner Center, **Start your submission**:
   - **Packages:** upload the `.msixbundle` (and the `.classic.appxbundle` if one was made)
   - **Properties:** category *Shopping*; privacy policy URL
     `https://amanchaudhary21.github.io/shopnest-store/privacy.html`
   - **Age ratings:** answer the questionnaire
   - **Store listings:** description and at least one screenshot
     (say it is a demo store with no real purchases)
6. **Submit to the Store.** Certification usually takes a few days.

## How to run it

**Easiest:** double-click `public/index.html`. It opens in your browser. No internet needed
(with internet you also get the nicer Google fonts).

**With the little web server** (needed for "Sign in with Google"):

```bash
npm start
```

or double-click `start.bat`. The store opens at <http://localhost:8080>. You need
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18 or newer. Nothing to install with npm.

```

The JS files must load in the order listed at the bottom of `public/index.html`.
Each file uses things made by the files above it.

## Easy things to try

Edit, save with Ctrl+S, then press F5 in the browser.

- `public/index.html`: find `<span>shopnest</span>` and type your own shop name.
- `public/js/core/data.js`: find `const FREE_SHIP_MIN` and change `SHIP_STD = 4.99` to `SHIP_STD = 2.99`.
  Standard delivery now costs $2.99.
- `public/js/core/data.js`: change the words of any product title. It changes everywhere.
- `public/css/style.css`: the colors are the variables at the very top (`--brand`, `--accent` ...).
  The first block is the light theme; the dark theme blocks come right after it.

If something looks broken after an edit, undo with Ctrl+Z and save again.
A small typing mistake in a JS file can stop the whole page.

## Signing in

Everyone must sign in before they can shop:

- **Email and password**: click "Create account" the first time.
- **Phone number**: type your number, then the 6-digit code. This demo can't send real
  text messages, so the code is shown on the screen.
- **Google**: needs a one-time setup (below).

Each account has its own cart, wish list and orders. Click the round letter button in the
top-right corner of the store to sign out. "Reset demo data" in the footer clears only your data.

### Turning on "Sign in with Google" (one-time, free)

1. Start the store with `npm start` or `start.bat` (Google sign-in does not work from a double-clicked `index.html`).
2. Go to <https://console.cloud.google.com>, make a project, then open **APIs & Services → Credentials**.
3. Click **Create credentials → OAuth client ID**, type **Web application**.
   Under **Authorized JavaScript origins** add `http://localhost`, `http://localhost:8080`
   and, for the live site, `https://amanchaudhary21.github.io`.
4. Copy the Client ID (it ends with `.apps.googleusercontent.com`).
5. Open `public/js/core/auth.js`, find `const GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = "";` and paste it between the quotes.
6. Save and reload. The Google button now shows on the sign-in page.

Accounts are saved per address, so accounts made on the double-clicked `index.html`
and on `http://localhost:8080` are separate.

## Selling and deleting your items

Click the **+** button in the header to sell an item: choose a photo, add a name and price, and save.
Your items have a red **Delete item** button on their card and a **Delete this item** button on
their product page. Only you see these buttons.

## Deleting products for everyone (shop server + MySQL)

When the owner (amanecdy@gmail.com) deletes a store product, the `backend` server saves that in
MySQL, and every shopper's store hides it within 30 seconds (straight away on their next visit).

1. Make `backend/local.properties` (it is not uploaded to GitHub) with your MySQL password and an owner password:

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.password=your-mysql-root-password
   app.owner-password=choose-a-long-password
   ```

2. Start the server (needs Java 25). The `shopnest` database is made on the first start:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

   It runs at <http://localhost:8081>. Keep `start.bat` running too for the store itself (port 8080).
3. Sign in to the store as the owner, open **Sell an item**, and enter the owner password under
   **Deleted store products** to connect. Now **Delete item** removes a product for every shopper,
   and **Restore all** brings them back.

The store uses the server only when it is opened at `localhost`. To use it on the live site,
host the backend online and put its address in `API_URL` at `public/js/core/data.js`
(and add the site's address to `app.cors-origins`).
